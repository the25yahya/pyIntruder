This tool can be implemented using either object-oriented programming (OOP) or functional programming. However, OOP might be more suitable for this scenario because of the modularity, maintainability, and flexibility it offers, especially if you plan to expand the tool in the future. Here's why:

Why Choose OOP?
Modularity:

You can create classes for parsing requests, handling brute force logic, and analyzing responses. This keeps the code organized.
Extensibility:

Adding new features, such as support for additional response analysis, becomes easier with well-defined classes.
State Management:

OOP can manage state across different stages of the tool's workflow (e.g., parsed HTTP request, selected brute force field, criteria for stopping).
Suggested Modules
Here's a list of modules you might need for the tool:

Standard Library:

argparse: For handling command-line arguments if needed later.
os: For handling file paths (e.g., wordlist files).
re: For advanced field matching or validation.
sys: For handling user inputs and exits.
HTTP Handling:

requests: For making HTTP requests during brute-forcing.
Concurrency (optional for speed):

concurrent.futures or threading: For parallelizing brute force attempts.
Response Analysis:

beautifulsoup4: For parsing and analyzing HTML content in responses.
js2py or py_mini_racer: For detecting or evaluating JavaScript execution in responses.
File Handling:

pathlib: For managing file paths in a cross-platform way.
Utility:

logging: For real-time feedback and debugging information.
General Class Design (OOP Approach)
HttpRequestParser:

Parses the raw HTTP request and converts it into manageable components (method, URL, headers, body).
BruteForceEngine:

Handles brute force logic by replacing user-specified fields with payloads from the wordlist.
ResponseAnalyzer:

Checks responses for user-defined criteria (e.g., term matching, JavaScript execution).
ToolManager:

Coordinates interactions between the parser, brute force engine, and analyzer.
